# Project Name: Diffusion Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates the diffusion of particles in a 2D grid. The simulation uses a simple random walk algorithm to model the movement of particles over time. The goal of the project is to demonstrate the concept of diffusion and how it can be used to model various real-world phenomena, such as heat transfer, mass transport, and disease spread. It's a small project I created to start a complex one. Hope this will helpfu

## Features

* 2D grid representation
* Random walk algorithm for particle movement
* Particle tracking and visualization
* Time-step animation
* Statistical analysis of particle distribution

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and install required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hasihays/diffusion-simulation.git
cd diffusion-simulation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the simulation:

```bash
python app.py
```

3. Interact with the simulation:
   * Use the arrow keys to navigate through the grid.
   * Press 'p' to pause/resume the simulation.
   * Press 's' to save a snapshot of the current state of the grid.
4. Analyze the results:
   * Use the statistical analysis tools provided in the 'analysis' directory to analyze the particle distribution.
5. Visualize the results:
   * Use the visualization tools provided in the 'visualization' directory to create images and videos of the simulation.

## Configuration

The configuration file 'config.yaml' contains settings for the simulation, such as the size of the grid, the number of particles, and the time step. You can edit this file to change these settings and run the simulation with different parameters.
